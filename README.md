# Getting Started
## Setup with Docker
This project is configured to use Docker.
#### Docker Configuration
The Docker environment is defined in a `docker-compose.yml`.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Runs PostgreSQL server on port "5432:5432".
- **RabbitMQ**: Provides a RabbitMQ server on ports "5672:5672" and "15672:15672".
  RabbitMQ's configuration file
  located in package `com/example/bankingSolution/rabbitmq`.
RabbitMQ is used while crating a new account and while creating a new transaction.
- **Springboot application** runs on port "8080:8080".
#### Building and running the application
To build and start the services defined in the Docker configuration,
run the following command in the root directory of the project: `docker-compose up --build`.
## Database
This project uses Liquibase for database schema management.
Below is an overview of how the changelogs are structured in this project.
The Liquibase changelogs are located in the `resources/db/changelog` directory within the project.
- **`changelog-master.xml`**: This is the root changelog file.
- **`changelog-tables.xml`**: This file contains the database schema changes.
- **`changelog-insert.xml`**: This file is used for inserting initial data into the database.
### Database structure
The database for this project is designed of
four key tables: `customers`, `accounts`, `balances`, and `transactions`.

#### Enum Usage in Database Management
Countries, currencies, and transaction directions are handled using enums.
Before any data related to these fields is added to the database, it undergoes
checks against these enums to ensure that only valid values are used.
This method were chosen because using enums reduces the complexity of validation logic in the application.
### MyBatis
This project utilizes MyBatis to facilitate the mapping between application and the database.
#### MyBatis Configuration
The mappers are located under the `resources/mapper` directory.
Results are mapped in corresponding files in package `com/example/bankingSolution/dao`.

## Functionality
#### Account creation
- **Endpoint** : `http://localhost:8080/api/account/add`
- **Example body**: {
  "customerId": 3,
  "country": "IT",
  "currencies": ["EUR"]
  }
- **Result**: {
  "id": 1,
  "customerId": 1,
  "balances": [
  {
  "amount": 10.00,

  },
  {
  "amount": 2500.00,
  "currency": "USD"
  }
  ]
  }

  "id": 3,
  "customerId": 3,
  "balances": [
  {
  "amount": 0.00,
  "currency": "EUR"
  }
  ]
  }
- **Possible errors**:
- - "error": "No account with ID: id"
#### Transaction creation
- **Endpoint** : `http://localhost:8080/api/transaction/add`
- **Example body**: {
  "accountId": 2,
  "amount": 15,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "direction": "IN",
  "description": "Shopping"
  }
- **Result**: "id": 6,
  "accountId": 2,
  "amount": 15,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "direction": "IN",
  "description": "Shopping",
  "balanceAfterTransaction": {
  "amount": 115.00,
  "currency": "EUR"
  }
- **Possible errors**:
- - "error": "No customer with ID: {id}"
- - "error": "Invalid country: {country}"
- - "error": "Invalid currency: {currency}"
- - "error": "Invalid direction: {direction}"
- - "error": "Insufficient funds"
- - "error": "Account with ID {id} does not have balance with currency {currency}"
- - "error": "accountId/amount/currency/direction/description cannot be null."
#### Get transactions by account id
- **Endpoint** : `http://localhost:8080/api/transaction/get/2`
- **Result**: [
  {
  "id": 3,
  "accountId": 2,
  "amount": 80.00,
  "currency": "SEK",
  "direction": "OUT",
  "description": "Gasoline"
  },
  {
  "id": 4,
  "accountId": 2,
  "amount": 150.00,
  "currency": "SEK",
  "direction": "IN",
  "description": "Present"
  },
  {
  "id": 5,
  "accountId": 2,
  "amount": 100.00,
  "currency": "EUR",
  "direction": "IN",
  "description": "Salary"
  }
  ]

- **Possible errors**:
- - "error": "No account with ID: {id}"

## Tests
Integration tests are located in package `src/test/java/integrationTests`.
For testing GET operations test data is generated by liquibase file
`changelog-insert.xml`.
## TPS
For testing tool was used **Apache JMeter**.
#### Test Parameters
- **Number of Threads (users)**: 100
- **Ramp-Up Period**: 100 seconds
- **Loop Count**: 10
- With the mentioned parameters, the system achieved a throughput of 67 transactions per second.
## Horizontal Scaling
- **Multiple servers**: The system must be specifically designed so that many servers can work together. This means planning how they will share the workload and support each other.
- **Coordination needs**: Because there are several servers, they need to communicate and cooperate very well to act like
a single system. This coordination is tricky and needs careful management.
- **Data replication mechanism**: Maintaining data consistency across multiple nodes 
requires data replication mechanisms, which can add additional
overhead to system and increase operational costs.
- **Budget**: Distributing traffic across multiple servers requires a good load 
balancing system. This system could be software-based or might involve specialized hardware, both of which can increase infrastructure costs.
